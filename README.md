# `modalities`

Logic, type theory, and category theory give three equivalent ways of
expressing computation. Logical theorems and axioms can be implemented as type
systems for programming languages using the Curry-Howard correspondence,
providing a novel means for safer code. This paper explores this connection and
uses a category theory interpretation of modal logic to present an
implementation of modal logic applied to distributed systems.
